Subject: Inquiry Regarding Interview Call for AI & ML Online Internship  



I trust this correspondence finds you in excellent health and high spirits. I recently submitted my application for the esteemed AI and ML online internship at StarFly Network, with the understanding that an interview invitation would be extended within the stipulated timeframe of 24 to 48 hours. Regrettably, I have yet to receive any communication regarding the aforementioned engagement.  

I am reaching out to ascertain whether there have been any inadvertent delays or if additional documentation or clarification is requisite on my part to facilitate the process. I remain keenly interested in contributing my expertise to the distinguished endeavors of StarFly Network in the dynamic domain of AI and ML.  

I would greatly appreciate your guidance or updates concerning the revised schedule, if applicable. Your assistance in this matter would be profoundly valued.  

Thank you for your time and attention. I eagerly await your response at your earliest convenience.
